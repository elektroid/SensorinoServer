flask restful cors extension has issues with CORS
It's easier to have eveything served from the same server/port

We use lighttpd that also provides a websocket "gateway/proxy" to mosquitto mqtt server

You should use a patched lighttpd

NOTE: we considered using nginx, but lighttpd  websocket proxying was easier
We could use nginx : http://enable-cors.org/server_nginx.html
The nginx conf in this directoty can also be used (launch start.sh)
